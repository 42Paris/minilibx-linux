This is the MinilibX, a simple X-Window (X11R6) programming API
in C, designed for students, suitable for X-beginners.


Contents

 - source code in C to create the mlx library
 - man pages (in man/ directory)
 - a test program (in test/ directory) is built
   with the library
 - a public include file mlx.h
 - a tiny configure script to generate an appropriate Makefile.gen


Requirements

 - MinilibX only support TrueColor visual type (8,15,16,24 or 32 bits depth)
 - gcc
 - X11 include files
 - XShm extension must be present


Compile MinilibX

 - run ./configure or make
   both will make a few tests, create Makefile.gen
   and then automatically run make on this generated Makefile.gen .
   libmlx.a and libmlx_$(HOSTTYPE).a are created.
   test/mlx-test binary is also created.


Install MinilibX

 - no installation script is provided. You may want to install
     - libmlx.a and/or libmlx_$(HOSTTYPE).a in /usr/X11/lib or /usr/local/lib
     - mlx.h in /usr/X11/include or /usr/local/include
     - man/man3/mlx*.1 in /usr/X11/man/man3 or /usr/local/man/man3
